Installation Instruction:
1. change mayavi version to 4.7.2

1. Model takes point cloud and grasps as input (networks.py)
2. Dictionary key values: 'pc' --> Point Cloud, 'transforms' --> list of grasp positions and pose

Abbrievations: 
qt --> quaternion
rt --> rotation translation
sa --> set abstrction

pointnet_radius in networks.py is 0.02 which is being passed in pointnet_sa_module
n_clusters      in networks.py is 128  -----             ""              ------

grasp_net.py losses, backward, forward

all losses losses.py -> reconstruction loss, kl divergence loss, confidence loss

3. train.py
4. test.py
5. data/base_dataset.py
6. grasp_sampling_data.py
7. Dont know about visualization and rendering, may be demo/ main.py
